1) Analyse text with AI 

In order to approach this, we need to detect the language from the text, extra features when analysing the text will be its sentiment,
extracting key phrases, entities and linked entities.

AI techniques will apply statistical and semantic models to enable developers to create applications that extract:
- meaning
- insights

There is a public API that can be utilised to your own code.

When detecting, here are a few things:

1) Language detection
2) Key Phrases extraction
3) Entities and Entity Linking as well as Entity Recognition
4) Sentiment analysis


Example of a JSON format when detecting language. This can be used to send to the input stream such as Event Hub input (source) to evaluate following text
such as Language Detection, first.  By adding extra metadata such as country hint, it will help improve the prediction performance. 

{
    "kind": "LanguageDetection",
    "parameters": {
        "modelVersion": "latest"
    },
    "analysisInput":{
        "documents":[
              {
                "id": "1",
                "text": "Hi",
                "countryHint": "UK"
              },
              {
                "id": "2",
                "text": "Bonjour"
              }
        ]
    }
}
