Containers enables you to host Azure AI services either:
- on-premises
- in Azure

If your application uses sensitive data in an on-premises SQL server
to call an Azure AI services service,you can deploy Azure AI services 
in containers on the same network.

Now your data can stay on your local network and not be passed to the cloud.
Deploying Azure AI services in a container on-premises will also decrease
the latency between the service and your local data, which can improve
performance.

Learning to create containers for reuse, deploy the container and secure it.
At the same time, we would like to consume the Azure AI services from a container.

Use Azure AI services containers

There are container images for Azure AI services that can be used to deploy a containerized
services that encapsulates the individual Azure AI services service API.
