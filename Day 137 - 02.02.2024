AI is becoming popular and prevalent in the software applications we use every day, including digital assistants in our homes, phones, automotive technology in the vehicles that take us to work, and smart productivity applications that help us to do our jobs when we get there.

AI, can help on the visual perception to use the ability of computer vision capabilities to:
Accept
Interpret
Process Input from Images
Video Streams
Live Cameras

Text Analysis and Conversation (NLP) - to not only read but to generate realistic responses and extract semantic meaning from text.

Speech - The ability to recognise speech as input and synthesize spoken output. The combination of speech capabilities together with the ability to apply NLP analysis of text enables a form of human-compute interaction thatâ€™s become known as conversational AI, which users can interact with AI agents (usually referred to as bots) in the same way they would with another human. 

Decision-making - The ability to use past experience and learned correlations to assess situations and take appropriate actions.  For example,  recognising anomalies in sensor readings and taking automated action to prevent failure or system damage.

These kind of capabilities are increasingly within the reach of everyday software applications, helping making them more intuitive and useful in a wide variety of scenarios that previously existed in science fiction.
